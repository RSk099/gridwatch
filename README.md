# GridWatch 

GridWatch is an application designed to provide real-time insights into the energy mix and carbon emissions of the United Kingdom's power grid. This app presents a snapshot of energy sources used to meet power demands, including fossil fuels, renewables, and imports, along with live data on carbon intensity and energy pricing.

Development endpoint:

## Data Sources

[Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk)

[Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service API](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk)

## TODO:
- Switch from BMRS to Elexon Insights Service
- Add interconnectors under imports
- Show the interconnectors maximum capacity and their current usage
- Add an on-hover to the demand chart, showing the specific values at each time
- Add Generation chart, showing each type and their generational output
- Add price per MWh
